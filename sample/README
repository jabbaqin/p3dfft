---------------------

This directory contains example programs for using P3DFFT, both 
in FORTRAN and C (in separate subdirectories). To compile the 
examples, edit makeinc (see P3DFFT installation guide for details). 

FORTRAN/ directory contains:

driver_sine.f - program initializes a 3D array of real numbers as 
  a sine wave. It calls forward real-to-complex FFT and then backward
  complex-to-real FFT, checking to see if the original results were
  reproduced (a maximum deviation is printed). This program expects
  an ASCII file 'stdin' in the running directory, containing five numbers
  in a single line:

  Nx,Ny,Nz,Ndim,Nrep
 
  The first three numbers are box dimensions. Ndim is the number of 
  dimensions for processor decomposition, currently 1 or 2 (2 recommended). 
  Nrep is the number of repititions (for timing runs). In addition the 
  working directory may optionally contain a file 'dims', with two 
  numbers in a line, specifying the desired dimensions of the processor 
  grid. The product of these numbers should be equal to the total numer 
  of tasks. If this file is absent, a default grid geometry is used. 

driver_sine_inplace.f - this program is the same as driver_sine, except 
  the input and output arrays are the same. When allocating this space
  the size of the output array is used as it is usually a little larger 
  due to the middle Fourier mode being present in full. 

driver_rand.f - this program is the same as driver_sine, except the 
  input array is initialized with random numbers. 

driver_spec.f - this program initializes a 3D real array, calls 
  forward real-to-complex FFT, and computes power spectrum based on the 
  complex Fourier coefficients. 

driver_ghost.f - this program illustrates the use of ghost cell features.
  please note that ghost cell support is off by default

C/ directory contains analogous programs written in C rather than Fortran.
